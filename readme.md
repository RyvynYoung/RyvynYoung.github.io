#### Supply Chain - Units per Hour  
â€œWe manage what we measure, but frequently we measure what is easy" inspired by this quote I found a Kaggle dataset with units and pick time to evaluate.    
- Exploring the data I found that there was minimal variance in many features I expected to be predictive. 
- I found using a polynomial features model with order complexity was 65% more accurate in predicting the time needed to pick an order.

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project  
- Scrape 1K GitHub repository urls related to "environmental" to create a dataset for analysis. 
- Use NLP techniques to explore the data and build a model that predicts the programming language of the repository based on the text in the README.     
- Best performing model was a Logistic Regression using TF-IDF, final result was an average of 47% accuracy on unseen data.

#### Zillow Clustering Project
- Use Zillow dataset from Codeup cloud database  
- Using machine learning clustering to find groups within the data and build a model that predicts logerror
5 min notebook walk through     
- Identified 4 cluster groups within the data using KMeans algorithm. My best model unfortunately performed 3.6% under baseline using a Linear Regression algorithm.

#### Zillow Regression Project
- Use Zillow dataset from Codeup cloud database   
- Using machine learning build a model that predicts property tax value    
- Our best model was a 31% improvement over baseline using a Polynomial Regression algorithm

#### Telco Churn Classification Project
- Investigate Telco dataset for drivers of customer churn   
- Using machine learning build a model that predicts customer churn    
- My model increased customer churn prediction accuracy from 73% baseline to 87% using a Random Forest classification model
